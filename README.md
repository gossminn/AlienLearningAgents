# AlienLearningAgents

This project is a simulation of the acquisition of spatial semantics in natural languages. It is part of my BA Thesis (Linguistics, Leiden University, 2017). This is currently still work in progress, more information will be added soon.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Unity3D installed, as well as several 3rd-party plugins (some of them paid): AxeyWorks, City Props, Nature pack extended, and ToonMonsters. More detailed installation instructions will follow.
